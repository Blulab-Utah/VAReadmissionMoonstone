
? What is most needed?

1- Salomeh's no-mention stats for Monday talk.  I need to look at all the patients, see which patient/variables have "no mention", find which percentage of each classification is assigned by WEKA for each classification.  The percentage of "no mention" for each patient should not be 90%.

2- Test trained WEKA classifier against Phase2 cases.  Parse phase2 documents and created MoonstoneSaved.  Then load those annotations and create ARFF test files.

********
THIS WEEK:  i- Release all document texts in workbench.  ii- Make sure that patients in phase1 are the same as in training sets used for WEKA.  Run patient comparisons for Salomeh. iii- Implement patient classification class, means to import EHost files to tabular files, means to store Moonstone WEKA results in those files, and means of comparing two annotators are patient level.  iv- Synch Moonstone versions from home and VINCI.  4- Fix OWL grammar extraction.

? How to indicate that if you have any sentence with a provided communicating with a family, that is support?  Intervening words don't count.

COULD:  i- Add Provider::InteractWith::Family

? How to generate new training ARFF file?

DO:  i- TextInputDir = directory containing all test sets. Use "corpus" as constraint. ii- Results file:  named in tsl.properties.  iii- Ehost directory= same as input.  Use "truthset" as constraint.

PROBLEM:  I am currently reading in the entire corpus into the workbench, then reading it again for the EHost patient analysis.

COULD:  i- Create a separate parameter for EHostTextInputDirectory.  If that is found, use that instead of TextInputDirectory parameter.  

******
HOW TO IMPLEMENT NEW INTEGRATED TRAINER:

1- Write function that iterates over all annotations for a given concept and writes the sentences with those annotations to a file.  Use that file for training.  2- Upgrade the ontology. 

? Should I use constants or specialized types?  What ware the principles?

THOUGHTS:  1- Types can exponentially increase if I start combining lower into higher types.  I should keep types abstract, and use compound constants to represent useful combinations of ideas. 2- OTOH, there needs to be a hierarchy, e.g. family giving patient a ride is an instance of family helping patient is an instance of person helping person which is an instance of ComplexEvent.  Could have ontology tree that includes Action+Object, Action+DObject+IObject, Action+DObject+Destination, Subject+Event, Person+HelpingEvent+Person as subtype of Subject+Event, etc.  These would be the upper ontology, and could be included in other ontologies.  Could create a StringConstant automatically for every type, as a way to represent term instance of that type.  

Intermediate types:  PersonRelationToPlace, PersonLivingSomewhere, PatientLivingAtHome, SomeoneLivingWithSomeone, PatientLivingWithFamily,
FamilyLivingWithPatient, PersonHelpingPatient, PersonHelpingPatientWithALDS, PersonHelpingPatientGetSomewhere, PersonHelpingPatientGetToMedicalFacility, PatientTravelSomewhere, etc.

SKELETAL IDEAS FOR TYPE HIERARCHY:

Clinical Reminders Activity
   HOMELESS SURVEY:
    In an effort to end homelessness for our veteran's, please ask each
    veteran about their current housing status at least once a year to
    identify veterans that may be homeless or at risk of becoming
    homeless. 
           Note: ** items require handoff/Consult to a social worker. (Lee:  Jumps too quickly to target concept from "homelessness".  Too little exposure to this concept in training; did not weed out sources of FPs)


Veteran stated that the granddaughter doesn't work, and 
is able to stay home with Veteran's son, while he still works at a local 
church and volunters in homeless person food drives.

SW informed her 
of the information the Veteran has provided regarding his past SNF [stays which 
she] was able to confirm, and also reports that she may be able to help the 
Veteran remember which Nursing Homes he has disliked staying in the past to

Do you feel stress between caring for your relative] and trying to meet other 
responsibilities (work/family)? 

Mrs. Melchiorri's inpatient physician and staff were informed that Mrs. 
Melchiorri would not be able to come to the hospital until tomorrow because [she 
will not have a ride] until that time. 

 "I'm 94 years old and never felt this bad". "No one will help me. "I'm 
going to die." "Can someone go get me some Epsom Salts?" (Lee:  Patient's verbalizations)

Do not stop taking your medicines [without talking to your caregiver].  (Lee:  Templated instructions, overly general negation. As C&P, this appears in multiple documents.)

 Instruct patient to [not get OOB without assist].  (Instructions; 6 template instances.)

************************************************
CHANGES TO TRY WITH HOMELESS FPS:

Include "survey" with words to omit.  Let the gatekeeper rule omit if the sentences has > N words; same for all document "homeless"-related rules.  Add "stable + living + situation".  Add "with, at" to LivingArrangementRules.stay-with-friend-indicates-marginal-housing-rule.  Add "0" to header negation. Interpret "homeless" as ":HOMELESSNESS:" and require patient to be subject, or in header rule, or in short sentence, to jump to ":POSSIBLE_HOMELESSNESS:".

************************************************
? How to remove target duplicates?

To just remove duplicates I iterate over the list, adding each annotation to the list if it hasn't already been added.  Now, I need to remove all annotations with the same concept and overlapping another annotation, but with lower ID.

COULD:  If two annotations are the same, add the id to sameAnnotationHash.  For each annotation, if it is in sameannotationhash, add it and remove from sameannotationhash.

 **********
 CHANGES 1/15/2017:  In finding relevant document parse input, don't search children of negated child.  Took out search of all annotations in gatherDocumentGrammarInput() if no relevant annotations found.  Removed lower concepts from generated index tokens; this has immediate effect of removing :CHECKBOX_UNCHECKED: from indices, allowing unchecked checkbox items to pass capture filter.
 
 1/17/2018:  Added concept to gate equivalence table, so that if have :NOT_HOMELESS:, don't permit :POSSIBLY_HOMELESS: also.  Add JavaFunction that determines whether "no" is immediately followed by newline, to suppress attachment of "no" to checklist item below.

TASK:  Generate features for patient classifier.

NOTES:  i- Need to avoid features that are negated or lead to implicitly negative features higher up.

COULD:  Walk each parsetree, and if the concept is not negated, add it to table.  If negated, break out.

? What to do with word-level annotations? Could:  i- ignore them- just use normalizations.

? How to include patient classification?  

COULD:  i- Keep another table with "patid + variable" = "classification".  Print to another file.

Function pathway to ARFF feature creation:
actionPerformed("generateMultipleReadmissionPatientResultsARFFTrain").analyzeMultipleCasesFromSingleFolder.ReadmissionPatientResults.analyzeTrainingSet.processPatients.processFilesMultiLayer.invokeMoonstoneARFF(document).invokeMoonstoneARFF(document, variable, annotations).addFeature.addFeature

DO: Add new processing mode. In processFilesMultiLayer(), call invokeMoonstoneProcessSingleLinePatientClassifierFeatures(doc), which mimics invokeMoonstoneARFF(doc).

? Where to store the files?
